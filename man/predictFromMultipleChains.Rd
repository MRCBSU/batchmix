\usage{
predictFromMultipleChains(
  mcmc_outputs,
  burn,
  point_estimate_method = "median",
  chains_already_processed = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mcmc_outputs}{Output from ``runMCMCChains``}

\item{burn}{The number of MCMC samples to drop as part of a burn in.}

\item{point_estimate_method}{Summary statistic used to define the point
estimate. Must be ``'mean'`` or ``'median'``. ``'median'`` is the default.}
}
\value{
A named list of quantities related to prediction/clustering:

 * ``allocation_probability``: List with an $(N x K)$ matrix if the model is 
   semi-supervised. The point estimate of the allocation probabilities for
   each data point to each class.

 * ``prob``: $N$ vector of the point estimate of the probability of being
   allocated to the class with the highest probability.

 * ``pred``: $N$ vector of the predicted class for each sample. If the model
   is unsupervised then the ``salso`` function from Dahl et al. (2021) is 
   used on the sampled partitions using the default settings.

 * ``samples``: List of sampled allocations for each view. Columns
   correspond to items being clustered, rows to MCMC samples.

\description{
Applies a burn in to and finds a point estimate by combining
multiple chains of ``callMDI``.
