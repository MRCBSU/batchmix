# batchmix
Semi-supervised and unsupervised Bayesian mixture models that simultaneously infer the cluster/class structure and a batch correction. Densities available are the multivariate normal and the multivariate t. The model sampler is implemented in C++. This package is aimed at analysis of low-dimensional data generated across several batches. See [Coleman et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.14.476352) for details of the model.
